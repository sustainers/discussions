## Discussions

We don't have a lot of guidelines about participating here. The goal is to share our experiences and learn from each other.

* Ask questions.
* Talk about challenges.
* Share tips, tricks, and best practices.
* Tell stories.

This repository is not for GitHub feature ideas/requests. Instead, talk about the problems you're facing and ask for suggestions on solving them.
